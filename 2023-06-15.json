Is there another explanation that is more likely than the claim? Is there evidence that contradicts the claim?</li>\n<li><strong>Using your common sense:</strong> Finally, you need to use your common sense when evaluating a claim. Does the claim make sense? Is it believable? Is it something that you would expect to be true?</li>\n</ul><p>If you tell me about a suspicious claim, I can use these methods to evaluate whether it is likely to be misinformation.

      "response": "<p>No, I don't think this is misinformation. The elimination time constant for ivermectin is about 0.04/day. This means that it takes about 25 days for half of the ivermectin in your body to be eliminated.</p><p>The elimination time constant is a measure of how quickly a drug is eliminated from the body. It is calculated by dividing the natural logarithm of 2 by the elimination rate constant. The elimination rate constant is a measure of how quickly a drug is removed from the body by the liver and kidneys.</p><p>The elimination time constant for ivermectin is relatively long. This means that it can take several weeks for the drug to be completely eliminated from the body.
